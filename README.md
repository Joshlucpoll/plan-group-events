Are you sick and tired of having to organise events for large groups -- working out who's coming and who's not ðŸ˜°

Plane Group Events simple web app that allows you to create an event with:

- [x] Title
- [x] Date/Time
- [x] Organiser
- [x] Description _(optional)_
- [x] Location _(optional)_

It then provides you with a link to share to friends/family; then they can then decide to attend or not!

The organiser then has a list of people coming and can do the relevant bookings/reservations.
